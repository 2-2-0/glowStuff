# glowStuff
Processing functions to draw some glowing primitives

void glowText (String s, int x, int y, int offset, color c);
void glowBox (int x, int y, int w, int h, color c);
void glowPoint (int x, int y, color c, color spread);

I know, I know... you expected much more from this code.

I have tons of these much more optimized functions somewhere in my drive. I also have this urge to develop some visual flicker and visual artifacts for processing in the near future, so please expect a newer update: optimized, smarter, tidier version coming in the future....
